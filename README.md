# Having an issue with GitHoot?

Well, you know what to do then. Report as you would for any other GitHub project. Head over to [Issues][] and have at it. Be sure to search outstanding and closed issues before posting. Please supply as many details as you possibly can.

# Payment related or private issue?

If you'd rather keep your issue out of public eye, please write to <ins>hello AT git.ht</ins>. We'll do our best to respond and hopefully have your problem resolved promptly.

# Have a feature request?

At the time of this writing, GitHoot is missing a bunch of rather important features, but we're working on those. That said, we'd like to keep GitHoot minimal and feature poor without it losing its usefulness. Generally speaking we would rather avoid feature galore emblematic of so many other web services. In no particular order here are a few things coming to GitHoot soon:

- [ ] #1
- [ ] Your online identities signed and verified

If you still think GitHoot is missing something vital, feel free to bring it up in [Issues][].
